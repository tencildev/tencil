The icons of the ACP agents (Devin, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, OpenCode and
goose) are each agent's `icon.svg` in the
[ACP registry](https://github.com/agentclientprotocol/registry), used under the
Apache License 2.0, Tencil's own license. They're cropped to what they draw, and
Copilot's paths are merged into one.

The product names and logos shown by those icons belong to their owners.

## Dependencies

Installed next to `tencil` by npm, not bundled; each ships its own license:

| Project | License | Used for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [ws](https://github.com/websockets/ws) | MIT | Bridge WebSocket server |
| [zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) | MIT | Message validation |
| [picocolors](https://github.com/alexeyraspopov/picocolors) | ISC | CLI colors |

The [Claude Agent SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk)
is an optional peer dependency. Tencil neither bundles nor ships it: it is loaded
from next to Tencil, or installed into Tencil's config folder on first use of the
Claude Code provider, under Anthropic's own terms.

[Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) is neither bundled nor installed by Tencil:
the Codex provider runs the copy already on your machine.

The same goes for the agents the ACP provider runs, such as Devin, Gemini CLI or
OpenCode: Tencil starts the copy already on your machine, under its own terms.
